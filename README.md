The Temperature and Humidity Monitoring Project using a DHT Sensor involves creating a system to continuously measure and display temperature and humidity levels in an environment. The project typically uses the DHT11 or DHT22 sensor, which is known for its low cost and ease of use. Hereâ€™s a brief outline of the project:

Components:

1. DHT Sensor (DHT11 or DHT22): Measures temperature and humidity.


2. Microcontroller (e.g., Arduino, ESP8266, Raspberry Pi): Processes the sensor data.


3. Display Module (LCD/LED): Shows real-time data.


4. Power Supply: To power the microcontroller and sensor.


5. Optional: Wi-Fi Module for remote monitoring or data logging.



Working:

The DHT sensor continuously monitors the temperature and humidity in the environment.

It communicates the data to the microcontroller through a digital signal.

The microcontroller processes this data and displays it on an LCD or sends it to a remote server for logging.

You can also include features like setting temperature or humidity thresholds for alerts or automation.


Applications:

Home automation: Monitoring and controlling indoor conditions.

Greenhouses: Ensuring optimal growing conditions for plants.

Industrial environments: Monitoring environmental conditions for equipment safety.


Advantages:

Low cost and easy to implement.

Provides real-time monitoring.

Portable and customizable with additional sensors or features.


Future Scope:

Adding IoT capabilities to monitor data remotely via mobile apps or websites.

Integration with smart home systems for automation based on temperature and humidity levels.


This project is ideal for learning about sensors, microcontrollers, and basic data handling.
